### About me:
More than 10 years ago I graduated from chess school and believed that being a chess coach was my vocation. However, over time, I was carried away by programming. I began to study it on my own six months ago, and then I was advised the RS School course. I decided that it was time to change something in my life and decided to change my profession. I realized that learning programming brings me pleasure.
